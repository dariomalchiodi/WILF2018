### D. Malchiodi and A. M. Zanaboni

## Code enabling the replication of experiments described

The code requires a python 2 standard installation along with the
following libraries:
- numpy
- pandas
- matplotlib
- sklearn

Moreover, the optimization problems are solved through the gurobi
optimization tool, available at http://www.gurobi.com/ with free
unlimited licenses for academic users.

All experiments are gathered in the notebook shadow-learn-dogs.ipynb.
